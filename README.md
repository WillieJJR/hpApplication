# Harry-Potter-Dashboard

### **Background:** 

Maven Analytics initiated a challenge to create a Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard leveraging data from the Harry Potter Movies (1-8). As an Avid Harry Potter fan this was a dataset I really wanted to work and build something with. However, as someone who tends to prefer challenging themselves, I decided to build a Web-Based dashboard using Python, instead of any BI tools like Tableau/Power BI.

### **Workflow**

Initially, I created a design document and requirements document, as well as defined expectations for myself. A few highlights of the required functionality are listed below:
* The Dashboard must be character-centric - more of a low-level analysis rather than something that examines the franchise as a whole
* The Dashboard should be heavily influenced by the dialogue in each movie, as I imagine, insights from this will be much less obvious than other parameters for analysis
* The Dashboard should be interactive in some fashion (User Input changes the data being presented)
* The Dashboard must have a Harry Potter theme, since this is the data we're leveraging
* Lastly - HAVE FUN! This was the most important requirement for me

### **Data** 

The data that this tool leverages can be found at https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground

The data can also be found in this repository as well. I encourage any Harry Potter fans to take a look and see what you can find or build

### **After Thoughts** 

I thoroughly enjoyed this project and I believe that this is an interesting tool that can be leveraged to find out some useful information regarding specific characters. With the interactivity of this tool, I thought it would be a useful candidate to deploy to Heroku. Since I've never deployed a Python Application in Heroku I thought this would be a fun extension of the project.

The application can be found here: https://hptextapp.herokuapp.com/

### **Caveat**

This is still a work-in-progress and currently at the stage of an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) Product - there are just a couple of things that I would like to update and change when I am able to get some extra time:
* Optimizing Python Scripts
* Introducing a loading wheel
